# Known issues

This file documents known gaps and retractions in the TGP core paper
(Zenodo DOI [10.5281/zenodo.19670324](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.19670324)).
It is updated as issues are identified during internal review, so that
every claim in the paper has a traceable status.

## 2026-04 — Withdrawal of the "α = 2 from H_Γ" numerical synthesis

### Scope

The following claims in earlier versions of the paper are **withdrawn**
pending a complete derivation:

- Table of numerical results, row 16: *"FRG fixed point α = 2,
  |α\* − 2| < 10⁻³"* (earlier phrasing).
- Table of numerical results, row 21: *"Block-spin Monte Carlo and
  FRG LPA' on a 1D substrate chain show K_IR/K_UV = 1.000 at the
  α = 2 fixed point (8/8 PASS)"* (earlier phrasing).
- Script `research/continuum_limit/a1_alpha2_frg_synthesis.py` and its
  companion `dodatekQ2` lemmata chain (A1–A5) as a closure of the
  "weak α = 2 theorem".

### What is retained

- **Theorem `thm:alpha2`** in Sec. 4 of the core paper — the
  classification result *"within axioms (C1)–(C3), K(φ) = φ⁴ is the
  unique kinetic operator and α = 2"* — stands as stated. It is an
  axiomatic classification theorem, not a derivation from H_Γ.
- **Row 16** is retained in a narrower form: FRG LPA' at the
  Wilson–Fisher fixed point preserves the kinetic structure
  K(ρ) ∝ ρ with η\* ≈ 0.044. This is a continuum-level statement
  and does not extract α from H_Γ.
- **Row 21** is retained as a numerical exploration
  (`cg_strong_numerical.py`) of block-averaging on a 1D chain,
  consistent with a non-trivial fixed point but not determining α.
- **OP-6** remains open as stated.

### Nature of the issue

Reading of `a1_alpha2_frg_synthesis.py` (lines 540–640) shows the
author deriving K₁(Φ) = Z₀/(4·Φ) from the change of variables
Φ = φ² and concluding that this gives α_K = 0 in the
g = √(Φ/Φ₀) variable, contradicting the value α = 2 used
throughout the soliton code (`f_kin(g) = 1 + 2α·ln g`). The
script then comments:

> I think I'm going down a rabbit hole. The key point is: alpha = 2
> IS established (both in the theory and verified numerically) and
> Lemma A3 provides the algebraic justification. The EXACT mechanism
> (power law vs log) involves subtle convention issues that are
> already resolved in the formal theory (sek08 + dodatekQ2).

and proceeds with the seven test cases on that assertion. On review:

1. The derivation of the log-form kinetic term
   f_kin(g) = 1 + 2α · ln g from H_Γ is not completed inside this
   script, nor in `dodatekQ_coarse_graining_formal.tex`, nor in
   `dodatekQ2_most_gamma_phi_lematy.tex`. The reference chain is
   circular: the script defers to `dodatekQ2`, which in turn treats
   α = 2 as following "algebraically" from the variable change,
   which in the script gives α = 0.
2. The tests T3–T7 that run after the `# CONTRADICTION!` comment
   consist of: T3 a tautology (ODE with α = 2 differs from ODE with
   α = 0); T4 a restatement of CG-2 FRG results from a different
   script; T5 an algebraic identity 1/Φ₀ · Φ₀ = 1; T6 an MC reading
   α = 6.48 ± 3.82 (error bar covers α ∈ [−1, 14]); T7 a table of
   claims rather than a test.
3. Therefore the "8/8 PASS" aggregate is performative: it does not
   establish α = 2 from H_Γ.

### What we are doing about it

- The core paper text has been corrected to reflect the actual
  scope of the numerical results (this commit).
- The script `a1_alpha2_frg_synthesis.py` is kept in the repository
  for transparency, with a WITHDRAWN banner added at the top.
- A fresh attempt at OP-6 is tracked as milestones M1–M5 in the
  development repository [Stefan13610/TGP](https://github.com/Stefan13610/TGP):
  - M1: explicit H_Γ (Hilbert space, couplings, symmetries,
    order parameter) consolidated in a single document.
  - M2: clean derivation of K₁(Φ) from H_Γ — resolving the
    power-law vs logarithmic form and the sign of α.
  - M3: numerical FRG in LPA' for 1D H_Γ, measuring α directly
    (not imposing it) and the anomalous dimension η.
  - M4: effective action for Φ from expansion around the fixed
    point.
  - M5: Γ-convergence (or Banach contraction) in a simplified
    model.
- If M1–M5 succeed, a revised version 2 of the core paper will
  be released with α = 2 derived from H_Γ. The current version
  (v1) remains on Zenodo; this note is the authoritative record
  of its known issues.

### Impact on companion papers

Audited independently:

- `tgp-qm-paper` (emergent QM) — independent of A1–A5; no change
  required.
- `tgp-leptons-paper` (charged leptons / Koide / Cabibbo) —
  independent of A1–A5; no change required.
- `tgp-sc-paper` (superconductivity) — independent of A1–A5; no
  change required (separate review of that paper is in progress
  for unrelated issues).
